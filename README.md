#:device_ejector
automatically ejects all new mass storage devices and ejects cd tray repeatedly. 
aids in protecting against ducky slurping atttacks, and irritates coworkers

#:clipboard_replacer
can probably use for something useful. mostly for running on someones computer
and having inappropriate links be pasted instead. message based tech support, anyone?
